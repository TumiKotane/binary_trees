What are the average time complexities of those operations on a Binary Search Tree (one answer per line):

1. Inserting the value n

The average time complexity for inserting a value (n) into a BST is O(log n).


2. Removing the node with the value n

The average time complexity of removing a node with the value n from a BST is O(log n)


3. Searching for a node in a BST of size n

The average time complexity of searching for  a node with the size n from a BST is O(log n)
